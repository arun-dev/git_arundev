Adapter Pattern

An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly.
An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the clientâ€™s interface.

Consider a scenario in which there is an app that's developed in the US which returns
the top speed of luxury cars in miles per hour (MPH). Now we need to use the same app
for our client in the UK that wants the same results but in kilometers per hour (km/h).
